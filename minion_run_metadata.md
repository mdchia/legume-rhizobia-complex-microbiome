# MinION Run Metadata

## Run 1

*2018-04-18*

Contains just a sample of pure broth culture of *Bradyrhizobium japonicum* strain 36.1.

1Âµg DNA used.

Flow cell: FLO-MIN106 (rev C, probably)

Kit: Ligation, SQK-LSK108

Using MinKNOW 1.10.23

## Run 2

*2018-05-19*

Barcoded 4 samples using SQK-LSK108 (ligation) + EXP-NBD103 (native barcoding kit)

Strains of *B. japonicum* listed as follows

NB9: 36.8

NB7: 65.7

NB5: 213.6

NB12: *Eucalyptus* control sample

Flow cell: FLO-MIN106 (rev C, probably)

Using MinKNOW 2

## Run 3

*2018-07-03*

Barceded SQK-RBK004 (rapid barcoding kit)

- RB01: *Eucalyptus albens*

- RB02: *Eucalyptus sideroxylon*

- RB03: Soil "slurry" (suspension of fine particles from an environmental soil sample, used for inoculation)

- RB04: Mixture of 5 strains of *B. japonicum*

- RB05,06,07: Environmental soil samples

- RB08: Extraction from autoclaved sand. Should not contain plant DNA; Qubit indicated DNA below detectable levels

- RB09: *Eucalyptus melliodora*

RB03-08 were extracted using the QIAGEN Powersoil kit.

Using MinKNOW 2.0
