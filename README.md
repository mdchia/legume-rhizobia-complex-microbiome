# Legume-rhizobia interactions in a complex microbiome

Ming-Dao Chia, Anna Simonsen, Andrew Almonte, Justin Borevitz

## Why?

- Rhizobia (nitrogen-fixing bacterial plant symbionts) are relatively well studied in single strain inoculation experiments, in culture, and in relation to their plant hosts.

- Not as much is known about them in relation to other soil microbes, particularly uncultivated microbes.

- Recent developments in metagenomic methods allows studying abundance of rhizobia strains in nodules and free living environments with minimal culture or amplification bias.

## Aims

- Observing patterns of rhizobia strain abundance changes in legume nodules and associated soil.

- Observing patterns of rhizobia strain abundance changes in soil in the absence of a legume host.

- Looking for horizontal gene transfer events in known strains throughout the samples sequenced.

## How?

- Study species: legume *Acacia acuminata* with rhizobial symbiont *Bradyrhizobium japonicum* (4 strains).

- Plants are grown from surface sterilized seeds on autoclaved sand media for 8 weeks inside a growth chamber.

- A complex microbiome is inoculated from an external soil sample. Strains are inoculated at once as a balanced culture mix.

- DNA is extracted from sand and pots with a standard soil extraction kit.

- Long read sequencing conducted with Oxford Nanopore MinION.

- Abundances of strains are measured through counting reads. 

- Potential horizontal gene transfer events are identified bioinformatically.
